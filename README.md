# ERC House  

[ERC House](https://erchouse.com) is an open-source, decentralized exchange for new custom ERC token projects.  

Think of it as the Ebay of crypto tokens.  

Gone are the days of expensive ICOs and token listings. As a token project creator, simply pay a small registration fee to whitelist your token on our site, and then list your token for sale.  

As a buyer you can use our platform to find brand new, hot token projects, and become an early investor.   

## How to use

1. Anyone can use ERC House to list and sell their custom ERC tokens. Just visit the website at [https://erchouse.com](https://erchouse.com) and whitelist your token's contract address.  
2. Then, create a listing with your token. Select the amount of tokens you would like to sell, specify the price for each token, and specify the token in which you would like to receive payment.  
3. Your listing will appear on the front-page of the website, and an interested buyer can purchase all or some of your listing. The funds will automatically transfer to the corresponding wallets.
